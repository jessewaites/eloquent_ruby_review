Eloquent Ruby Review
===================


I created this repo because I find that I learn better if I take notes while I study. I've always wanted to do this book from start to finish and have decided to go ahead and do it. When it comes to programming books, there are 2 options: Read it and hope you retain it, or work through the samples are you come across them. I chose the latter. You can pretty much just ignore this repo all together. Or not... Whatever floats your boat!

----------


Chapter 1
-------------

Chapter 1 mostly discusses ruby style, such as using snake_case rather than CamelCase except for Class names.

Chapter 2
-------------

Chapter 2 covers control structures such as for, .each, case statements, and so on. I discovered while reading this that the for method ("for X in Y"
) calls the .each method anyway, so to go ahead and use .each whenever possible. Interesting.

Chapter 3
-------------

This chapter covers arrays and hashes, and the(*splat) operator.

Chapter 4
-------------
This chapter is all about ruby strings and how to manipulate them.

Chapter 5-30
-------------

To be continued....
